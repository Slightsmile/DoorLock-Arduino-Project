# üîê Digital Door Lock using Arduino

This project demonstrates a secure and smart **digital door lock system** built using Arduino Nano. It utilizes a **4x4 keypad** for user input, an **LCD display** for real-time feedback, and a **servo motor** to physically lock or unlock the door. This system is ideal for basic home or office security projects.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Working Principle

1. **Initialization**:
   - LCD displays: `WELCOME TO DOOR LOCK SYSTEM`
   - System is ready to receive input.

2. **Password Entry**:
   - User enters password via keypad.
   - LCD displays: `Enter Password` and shows the digits.

3. **Validation**:
   - If password is correct, servo motor rotates to unlock the door.
   - If incorrect, the lock remains engaged.

## üîÑ Workflow Summary

1. **Arduino Setup**:
   - Arduino Nano acts as the main controller.
2. **Hardware Connections**:
   - Keypad connected to D2-D9
   - Servo connected to D11
   - I2C LCD connected to A4 (SDA) and A5 (SCL)
3. **Code Upload**:
   - Use Arduino IDE to upload the code to the Nano.
4. **Enclosure Build**:
   - Components installed in a Styrofoam model for demonstration.
